## Hello! 👋🏼
Great to see you here! My name is Maheer and I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/). At McMaster, I am:
* Striving to create the best hackathon in Canada with DeltaHacks.
* Playing intramural basketball with some friends.
* Looking to optimize our timetable scheduling system? 👀

## What do I like doing? 🏀
My initial inspiration to pursue engineering stemmed from my passion for mathematics and physics. Over time, this has evolved into a particular interest in statistics, linear algebra, and programming, which I hope to explore fully soon.
