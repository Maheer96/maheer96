## Hello! 👋🏼
Great to see you here! My name is Maheer and I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/). Over here I am:
* Striving to create the best hackathon in Canada with DeltaHacks.
* Playing intramural basketball with some friends.
* Creating a programming database

## What do I like doing? 🏀
* My initial inspiration to pursue engineering stemmed from my passion for mathematics and physics. Over time, this has evolved into a particular interest in statistics, linear algebra, and programming, which I hope to explore fully soon.
* Outside of the classroom I really enjoy biking 🚴‍♂️ and playing sports with my friends ⛹️.

## What am I working on currently? 📡
* A programming database catered to individuals who wish to learn and teach simultaneously.
* An education platform that teaches matters I am most passionate about!
* A personal portfolio.
